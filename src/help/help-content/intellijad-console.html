    The IntelliJad console appears after a decompilation operation to report
    on what happened, and show any errors that occurred.
</div>

<div style="margin-bottom:5px; margin-top:5px;">
    Each decompilation report is represented by a top-level tree node, with the
    various steps that comprise it being organised in a way that associates them
    with the closest <i>major</i> operation, i.e. identifying and extracting class
    files from within a jar is reported under the "Jar extraction" group.
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:5px; margin-top:5px;">
    Each report is added to the bottom of the tree.

    <div class="sectionheader">Using the console</div>
    The console has five controls, situated to the left of the tree.
